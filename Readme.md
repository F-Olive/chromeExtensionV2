TITLE: "Leads Tracker"

DESCRIPTION: Can be used in any business environment looking to capture data from multiple websites quickly
using Google Chrome Browser, then export that data to an excel spreadsheet.

Takes user input data, saves it into a "myLeads" array.
2 ways to save it are via "SAVE INPUT" Button which allows user to type text into each 
input text box, as they choose and that data will be saved to the array.

Second option is the "SAVE TAB" Button, which uses a Chrome API option to save the 
name of the Chrome TAB of the page the user is currently on, along with the URL of that page.

All the data is saved in an <li> below the Buttons.

The saved data is fully editable via the ðŸ”§ icon.
Once clicked on the selected data appears in the input boxes for editing. Once editing complete the "SAVE INPUT" Button resaves the data.

When the user is ready to export the data to a .csv file, select the "DOWNLOAD" Button and the file saves as a "my_data.csv" file in the downloads folder.

HOW TO INSTALL EXTENSION: Google installing Chrome Extensions

KNOWN BUGS AND IMPROVEMENTS: 
1) Need to fill in all input text fields, in the first data set saved, otherwise the spreadsheet is permanently formatted with HEADERS only from the data fields filled in the first time data was saved. This could be fixed in the future.
2) A DELETE button next to each dataset, that deletes just one row of data, would be really useful. To do in the future.
